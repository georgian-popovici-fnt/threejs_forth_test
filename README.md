## Getting Started

This repository contains an Angular 18 application in the `space-modeller` directory.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v10 or higher)

### Setup Instructions

Before running any `ng` commands, you must install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd space-modeller
npm install
```

### Running the Application

After installing dependencies, you can use Angular CLI commands:

```bash
# Start development server
npm start
# or
npx ng serve

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "ng is not recognized as a command"**

This error occurs when npm dependencies haven't been installed. Solution:
1. Navigate to the `space-modeller` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies including Angular CLI
3. Use `npx ng` or `npm run` scripts to execute Angular commands
